The Formstack widget allows you to embed Formstack web forms into your sidebar. The widget automatically optimizes the web form's
CSS so that your online form will fit and look great in the sidebar.

The Formstack plugin will add a button to the TinyMCE editor that allows you to easily select a Formstack web form
you wish to embed. Once a form is selected, a shortcode will be inseterd into the editor, which will be converted
to the selected form once your page or post is rendered.

This plugin supports the following shortcodes `[Formstack]`, `[formstack]`, and `[fs]`.

This plugin requires a [Formstack](http://www.formstack.com "Online Form Builder") account and an API key.
